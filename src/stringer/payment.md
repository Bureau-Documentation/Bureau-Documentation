# Receiving Payment

<br><br>

### Payment Process

The way it works is that you (the stringer) would prepare an *invoice* and a *copyright release form* and send them to us

The payment process is handled by *Lotus Production Ltd.*, a production house under the Viory Video News Agency

Please [download the templates here](/Payment_document_templates.zip) and modify it accordingly


***

### Transfer Method

Choose *Paypal* as payment method or choose another account from another bank and check if the transfer fees might be lower

Please check the transfer fees charged by your bank or the intermediary bank

We make transfers with shared bank fees, meaning we only cover our bank fees

***

### After filling, Please send the documents to:

```
release@viory.video
beijing-producers@viory.video

CC   [the producerâ€™s email]
```
