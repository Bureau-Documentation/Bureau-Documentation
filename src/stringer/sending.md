<br><br><b>Still going strong! 79-year-old Iranian bodybuilder proves age is just a number</b>
<br><br>A 79-year-old bodybuilder in Iran is proving that age is no barrier to achieving peak physical fitness, as seen in footage captured in Tehran on Saturday.
<br><br>Davoud Nouri says he has been pumping iron for over 20 years and hopes to inspire young people to head to the gym and get in shape. “I am a role model for them at this age when I exercise, and if a young person wants to be lazy, they remember me and they will come to exercise themselves,” he said.
<br><br>Footage shows the elderly powerhouse doing pull-ups, lifting weights and running on treadmills to stay fit and healthy. “I enter the gym from 1:00 pm to 6:30 pm, every day I do 600 to 700 horizontal bar push-ups, parallels, and Swedish-style push-ups and after that, I lift weights,”
<br><br>The 79-year-old added that his primary motivator is to ‘not to get sick’, claiming that he has never taken shortcuts and has always looked after his health. “In my exercise, I have never taken supplements or drugs. I was motivated and interested in sports, and this is in my blood and I am still an athlete,” he added.
<br><br>The veteran athlete said he takes inspiration from fellow countryman Hadi Coopan - who won the Mr. Olympia competition in 2022 - and Ronnie Coleman from the United States, widely regarded as the greatest bodybuilder of all time.

<br>I’m very happy to be the bun tower queen this year. It’s a bit special, because I lost last year. So this year I faced this competition with a calm mind. And I didn’t prepare as much as I did last year, so there’s less pressure.

<br><br>Hong Kong, China: "Art Basel Hong Kong Returns to Full Scale, Spotlighting the City's Dynamic Art Scene"</b>
<br><br>Art Basel Hong Kong 2024, opened on March 26 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) in Wan Chai, promises to be a vibrant and diverse showcase of creativity.
<br><br>242 premier international galleries hailing from 40 countries and territories across Asia, Europe, North and Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, have come together to celebrate art in all its forms.
<br><br>Alain Servais, a collector from Belgium, remarked that "I'm really very impressed by the Discovery section. It's a tiny little part, but it's extremely high quality and the good prices. I would strongly recommend to you collectors to go through there and take some risks."
<br><br>The prestigious art fair offers a spectacular display of artistic talent, featuring a rich tapestry of artworks spanning different genres, styles, and cultural influences.
<br><br>Thousands of visitors can expect to immerse themselves in a dynamic and culturally enriching programme beyond the HKCEC venue as they explore the myriad perspectives and expressions brought forth by artists from around the globe.
<br><br>Following the Preview Days on March 26 and 27, the fair will run till March 30.
